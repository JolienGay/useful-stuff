#				HOW TO:
#		     push/pull files with Git Bash
#
##########################################################################

########## Pull from GitHub, push from local
# First, go to your GitHub account and make a new repository.
#	Don't forget to:
#		- check the box "Initialize this repository with a README"
#		- add .gitignore: R 
#		- add a license: GNU General Public License v3.0


# Clone your new repository from your GitHub account to your local file 
git clone https://github.com/JolienGay/example-repository


# Set your working directory to the cloned file
cd example-repository/


# Check the contents of your newly cloned file (should contain nothing 
# yet, but the README you've created)
ls


# After making changes to the local file, push them to your GitHub file 
# like this:
git add --all :/
git commit -m "Useful change"


# When previous commands were used for the first time, GitBash wants 
# you to do the following: 'Please tell me who you are.' 
git config --global user.email "gay.jolien@hotmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Jolien Gay"


# After configuring account details, try pushing the changes. 
# You're done when you don't get an error or merge conflict.
git push


# When you do get an error/merge conflict, this is probably because a 
# contributor to your repository made some changes you didn't pull yet.
git pull


# After the pull, you're stuck in an annoying window. Leave it by typing 
# the following steps:
#	- Move your cursor to an empty spot with the arrow buttons
#	- Type something like 'Trivial'
#	- Press the escape button, your cursor will now appear in the 
#	  bottom line of the window
#	- Type ':w', press enter
#	- Type ':q', press enter

# The normal window should appear, try pushing again.
git push



########## Additional notes
# cd .. (go a file back)
# cd ~/Documents/........ (~ =home folder or user folder)
